    "subtitle": "I have had the opportunity to work extensively with Next.js. The framework not only simplifies the creation of dynamic, server-rendered React applications but also offers powerful features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and efficient routing. Additionally, the built-in support for TypeScript and a thriving community contributed to a more maintainable and scalable codebase. Overall, Next.js has become my go-to framework for building performant and SEO-friendly web applications.",
